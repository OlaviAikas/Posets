# Posets
Implementation of posets and iposets (posets with interfaces) written in Julia, to study the properties of iposets.

This repository pertains to the research I did for my bachelor's thesis. I know the repository is a mess, but it's
because it was a simple collection of small scripts to analyse different sets of posets and iposets. The main
files of interest are posets.jl and iposets.jl which contain all of the important functions to manipulate graphs,
and the ever so important graph isomorphism algorithm that I wrote for this research.
